Config Error: OK. It is very likley that if you run `anvi-setup-scg-taxonomy` first you will
              be golden. Because even though anvi'o found the directory for taxonomy        
              headquarters, your setup seems to be missing 22 of 22 databases required for  
              everything to work with the current genes configuration of this class (sources
              say this is a record, FYI).
