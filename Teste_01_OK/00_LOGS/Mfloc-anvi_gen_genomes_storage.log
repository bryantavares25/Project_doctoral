WARNING
===============================================
Good news! Anvi'o found all these functions that are common to all of your
genomes and will use them for downstream analyses and is very proud of you:
'Transfer_RNAs'.

Internal genomes .............................: 0 have been initialized.
External genomes .............................: 8 found.

JUST FYI
===============================================
Some of your genomes had gene calls identified by gene callers other than the
anvi'o default, 'prodigal', and will not be processed. Use the `--debug` flag if
this sounds important and you would like to see more of this message.
